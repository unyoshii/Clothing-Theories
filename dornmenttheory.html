      <p class="description">
        The Adornment Theory suggests that clothing is primarily used for decoration and 
        self-expression rather than just practicality. Throughout history, people have 
        adorned themselves with fabrics, colors, and accessories to signify social 
        status, cultural identity, and personal style (Roach-Higgins &amp; Eicher, 1992). 
        From ancient Egyptian jewelry to modern fashion trends, adornment has been a key 
        aspect of human dress.<br><br>

        Fashion serves as a form of nonverbal communication, allowing individuals to express 
        emotions, personality, and group affiliation (Kaiser, 1997). Whether through elaborate 
        designs or minimalist styles, clothing helps people shape their identity and influence 
        how they are perceived.<br><br>

        In conclusion, adornment in clothing goes beyond function, reflecting personal, cultural, 
        and societal values. It remains a powerful tool for self-expression and social distinction.
