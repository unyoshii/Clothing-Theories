      <h1 class="page-title">Protection Theory portrayed in the Great Gatsby</h1>
      <p class="description">
         
        "The Great Gatsby," directed by Baz Luhrmann, in the year 2013 portrays a key scene that showcases the protection theory which is the moment when Gatsby throws his extravagant parties. These gatherings serve as a way for him to protect his vulnerable emotions and to mask his loneliness.
Gatsby's lavish lifestyle and the opulence of his mansion act as a shield against his past and the pain of unanswered love for Daisy Buchanan. The parties are not just about wealth; they are a desperate attempt to attract Daisy back into his life, illustrating how he uses materialism and spectacle as a form of emotional protection.
