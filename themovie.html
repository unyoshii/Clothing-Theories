        <p class="tagline">
            The Great Gatsby (2013) is a dazzling adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic novel, 
            directed by Baz Luhrmann. Set in the roaring 1920s, the film follows the mysterious millionaire 
            Jay Gatsby (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his unrelenting pursuit of Daisy Buchanan 
            (Carey Mulligan)—a former love caught in a complex web of wealth, status, and longing.
  
            Told through the eyes of aspiring writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), the story unfolds in a 
            world of lavish parties, glittering excess, and the relentless chase for the American Dream. 
            Beneath its glamorous surface, The Great Gatsby offers a cautionary tale about obsession, identity, 
            and the illusion of happiness. Luhrmann’s vibrant direction, modern soundtrack, and striking visuals 
            capture the frenetic energy of the Jazz Age, making the film both a stylish spectacle and 
            a poignant reflection on love and disillusionment.
