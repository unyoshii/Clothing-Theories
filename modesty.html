      <p class="description">
        The Modesty Clothing Theory suggests that the primary function of clothing is to cover 
        or conceal certain parts of the body. Rooted in cultural, religious, and social norms, 
        modesty in dress is thought to reflect humility, respect for oneself and others, 
        and adherence to community values. <br><br>

        Across different times and societies, modest fashion has taken many formsâ€”from 
        ancient garments that covered most of the body, to modern interpretations that adapt 
        traditional rules to contemporary styles. At its core, the Modesty Clothing Theory 
        underscores the idea that clothing is not merely decorative but also a moral, social, 
        and psychological extension of personal identity.
